## 1. üéØ Sprint Goal & Focus

*(What is the single most important thing we want to achieve? This should be a clear, concise statement that guides our decisions throughout the sprint.)*

The primary goal of this sprint is to **deliver a functional end-to-end user registration and login flow**. By the end of this sprint, a new user should be able to create an account, log in, and receive a valid session token. This work primarily supports the **{{epic_focus}}** epic.

## 5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Dependencies

*(What internal or external factors could jeopardize the sprint goal?)*

- **Risk:** The choice of JWT library has not been finalized, which could block `SPEC-102`. A decision is needed by Day 2 via `ADR-003`.
- **Dependency:** Awaiting the DevOps team to provision the new PostgreSQL database (related to `TICKET-SYS-50`).

## üèÅ Sprint Review & Retrospective (To be filled out at end of sprint)

### What We Shipped (Demo Notes)

*(A summary of the completed work demonstrated to stakeholders.)*

- Demonstrated the full user registration and login flow.
- Showcased the new protected API endpoints.
- Finalized the design for the "Forgot Password" modal.

### What We Learned (Retrospective)

- **What went well?** The ADR process for choosing the database was very effective and prevented debate during the sprint.
- **What could be improved?** Feature specs need to have UI/UX links earlier in the process to avoid blocking frontend work.
- **Action Item for Next Sprint:** Product will ensure Figma links are in specs *before* the sprint planning meeting.
