# 🚀 Epic: {{title}}

## 1. Executive Summary

*(This is the "elevator pitch" for stakeholders. Briefly describe what this epic is, who it's for, and the primary value it delivers. Keep it to 2-3 sentences.)*

This epic covers all work required to build a robust, secure, and user-friendly authentication system. This is foundational for all personalized features and will provide a seamless and secure entry point for our users.

## 2. Problem & Justification

### Problem Statement

*(Describe the user or business pain point. What is currently broken, inefficient, or impossible? Use data if you have it.)*

Currently, users have no way to create a persistent identity. This prevents us from offering personalized experiences, saving user data, or building features that require a logged-in state.

### Justification & Hypothesis

*(Explain **why** solving this problem is important now. How does it align with the `strategic_goals` listed in the front matter?)*

- **Alignment:** This is a prerequisite for our goal to "Increase User Trust and Security" and enables future personalization efforts.
- **Hypothesis:** We believe that by implementing a secure and smooth sign-up process, **we will increase new account creations by 15% month-over-month**, because users will see a clear path to a more valuable, personalized product.

## 3. Scope & Boundaries

### ✅ In Scope

*(List the clear, high-level deliverables. What will be true when this epic is "Done"?)*

- [ ] New user registration (email/password).
- [ ] User login with credentials.
- [ ] "Forgot Password" self-service flow.
- [ ] Secure session management using JWTs.
- [ ] API protection for authenticated routes.

### ❌ Out of Scope

*(Be explicit about what this epic does **not** include. This prevents scope creep and manages expectations.)*

- Social logins (Google, Facebook, etc.) - See EPIC-007.
- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) - See EPIC-008.
- Administrator user roles and permissions.

## 4. User Stories & Technical Breakdown

*(This is the master list of work required to complete the epic. Each item should correspond to a ticket or a more detailed feature specification.)*

| ID                               | Title                               | Status      | Sprint             |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| [TICKET-101](./tickets/TICKET-101.md) | User Registration Page & API        | `Done`      | `sprint-06-reporting` |
| [TICKET-102](./tickets/TICKET-102.md) | User Login Page & API               | `In Progress` | `sprint-06-reporting` |
| [TICKET-103](./tickets/TICKET-103.md) | Forgot Password Flow                | `To Do`     | `sprint-07-ux-polish` |
| [TICKET-104](./tickets/TICKET-104.md) | Secure Session Management           | `To Do`     | `sprint-07-ux-polish` |

## 5. 🎯 Success Metrics (Key Results)

*(How will we know if we succeeded? These should be quantifiable and directly related to the hypothesis.)*

- **Adoption:** New Account Creation Rate > 15% MoM for the first quarter.
- **Performance:** Login API endpoint latency < 200ms (p95).
- **Quality:** Login Success Rate > 99.5%.
- **Security:** Zero critical vulnerabilities reported related to authentication within 6 months of launch.

## 📈 Outcomes & Retrospective (To be filled out after completion)

### Actual Results vs. Hypothesis

*(Did we achieve our goals? Compare the `Success Metrics` to their actual measured values.)*

- **Account Creation Rate:** Achieved a 12% MoM increase. This was slightly below the 15% hypothesis, likely due to...
- **Performance:** Login latency averaged 150ms (p95), exceeding the goal.
- **...**

### Lessons Learned

*(What should we remember for the next epic?)*

- **What went well?** The component library accelerated UI development significantly.
- **What could be improved?** We underestimated the complexity of email deliverability for the "Forgot Password" feature. We should have scheduled a dedicated spike for this.
