**Status:** {{status}} on {{date}}

## 1. Context and Problem Statement

**(This section answers: "Is the problem relevant enough to be recorded?")**

Describe the issue, force, or constraint that drives the need for a decision. What is the scope of the problem? This should be a clear and concise description of the "why."

*Example: "Our user authentication service does not support multi-factor authentication (MFA), which is a critical security requirement for our upcoming enterprise release. We need to choose and implement an MFA strategy."*

## 2. Decision Drivers

**(This section answers: "Are the decision drivers (criteria) mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive? Are they prioritized?")**

List the key criteria and principles guiding this decision. These are the "lenses" through which you will evaluate the options.

*   **Driver 1:** Must support TOTP (e.g., Google Authenticator) and SMS-based codes.
*   **Driver 2:** Minimize development time and complexity.
*   **Driver 3:** Low operational cost.
*   **Driver 4:** High security and reliability.

## 3. Considered Options

**(This section answers: "Do the options have a chance to solve the problem? Are valid options missing?")**

List the different solutions that were considered. For each option, provide a summary and analyze it against the decision drivers.

### Option 1: Build a Custom MFA Solution In-House

*   **Description:** Develop our own services for generating and verifying MFA codes, and for sending SMS messages via a third-party provider like Twilio.
*   **Analysis against Drivers:**
    *   ✅ Supports TOTP/SMS.
    *   ❌ High development time and complexity.
    *   ❌ High operational cost (maintenance, monitoring).
    *   ⚠️ Medium security (requires significant security expertise to build correctly).

### Option 2: Integrate a Third-Party Identity Platform (e.g., Auth0, Okta)

*   **Description:** Delegate all authentication, including MFA, to a specialized Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) provider.
*   **Analysis against Drivers:**
    *   ✅ Supports TOTP/SMS and more (FIDO2, push notifications).
    *   ✅ Very low development time.
    *   ⚠️ Medium operational cost (monthly subscription fee).
    *   ✅ Very high security and reliability.

### Option 3: Use an Open-Source Identity Server (e.g., Keycloak)

*   **Description:** Host and manage a self-contained, open-source identity server that includes MFA capabilities.
*   **Analysis against Drivers:**
    *   ✅ Supports TOTP/SMS.
    *   ⚠️ Medium development time (integration and customization).
    *   ✅ Low operational cost (only hosting fees).
    *   ⚠️ High security, but requires in-house expertise for patching and configuration.

## 4. Decision Outcome

**(This section answers: "Does the chosen solution solve the problem? Is the rationale sound and convincing? Is it actionable?")**

**Chosen Option:** Option 2: Integrate a Third-Party Identity Platform (Auth0).

**Justification:** This option best satisfies our most critical drivers: minimizing development time and maximizing security. While it incurs a subscription cost, this is offset by the significant reduction in engineering effort and risk compared to building a custom solution or managing a complex open-source server. It allows the team to focus on our core product features.

**Actionable Plan:**
1.  Create a proof-of-concept integration with Auth0 in a feature branch.
2.  Schedule schema migration for the `users` table.
3.  Implement the login and registration flow using the Auth0 SDK.

## 5. Consequences

**(This section answers: "Are the positive and negative consequences reported as objectively as possible?")**

### Positive

*   Accelerates time-to-market for a critical feature.
*   Reduces the security burden on the engineering team.
*   Provides a clear path to implementing other advanced authentication features in the future.

### Negative

*   Creates a dependency on an external, third-party vendor.
*   Introduces a new monthly operational cost.
*   User data will be stored in a trusted third-party system, which must be communicated in our privacy policy.

## ADR Definition of Done Checklist

**(This self-assessment ensures the ADR meets quality standards before being finalized.)**

- [ ] **Evidence:** The decision is supported by a proof-of-concept, research spike, or trusted expertise. (Evidence gathered in: `link-to-spike-ticket` or `conversation-with-expert`)
- [ ] **Criteria:** At least two viable alternatives were considered and evaluated against the decision drivers.
- [ ] **Agreement:** The decision has been reviewed by the team and key stakeholders. (See `reviewers` field in front matter).
- [ ] **Documentation:** The decision, rationale, and consequences are clearly documented in this ADR.
- [ ] **Realization Plan:** Actionable next steps are defined and have been scheduled.
- [ ] **Review Plan:** A future review date has been set if this decision is time-sensitive. (See `review_date` field).
